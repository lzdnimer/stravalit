st.markdown("""## :robot_face: Tech used
* Python and [Polars](https://pola.rs/): Used to poll Strava's API, transform & aggregate the data, then load it to Supabase. I use Polars rather than Pandas ~~because I want to be different~~ because the syntax is simple and is [more performant](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2024/07/polars-vs-pandas/) when working with larger datasets.
* [Supabase](https://supabase.com/): I needed a platform to host my database and Supabase was perfect as it's free for the duration of my project and uses PostgreSQL. Connecting to the database is also super easy.
* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/): I wanted to make my project accessible and not hidden in a GitHub repo and I'm so glad I found Streamlit. I was hesitant at first as learning a new tool can often take time, but Streamlit's docs made picking up the syntax a walk in the park.
* [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions): I wanted to automate the process of updating the data presented on Streamlit and GitHub Actions worked well as it connected directly to my repository. There was definitely a bigger learning curve here compared to the other tools in this list, especially with the construction of the `.yaml` file needed to set up automation, and figuring out how to handle environment secrets.""")

st.markdown("""### Extract
This project uses my activity data which I access through Strava's API. After creating an app on Strava, I got an access key which I used in all my requests for data. This access key expires after 6 hours, and I have to use a refresh key to get a new access key.
            
My script checks if the access key has expired - if so, it POSTs a request for a new access key. Access token responses are loaded directly to Supabase.

### Transform
Once the data is retrieved, I make a few light transformations and aggregations, including:
* Filtering and renaming some columns
* Converting the `distance` column from metres to kilometres
* Casting the `start_date_local` column to a date column
* Creating a cumulative sum column for `elevation_gain` and a 7-day rolling window for `distance`

### Load
Data is then loaded into Supabase for storage, and charts are presented on Streamlit. Using GitHub Actions, I run this process every 15 minutes.""")

st.markdown("""I only needed 3 tables here:

1. `interactions`: stores kudos and comment counts. As these are slowly changing dimensions, I wanted these columns to be stored in a separate table from activities. `activity_id` here is a foreign key and references the `activities` table.
2. `activities`: where all other data related to an activity is stored. `activity_id` is the primary key.
3. `oauth_keys`: where my access and refresh keys are stored, along with the epoch value representing when the latest access key will expire.
            
### Loading data to tables
I ran a full load onto my Supabase DB the first time (to store any activities I recorded before the project). Any activities after that are then incrementally loaded.
            
For the `interactions` table, I get the most recent data from Strava's API and upsert any new changes via Supabase's API. For the `activities` table, I used an anti-join on my `activities` table in my Supabase DB and the latest activities gained from Strava's API to end up with a delta table of activities that are not yet in my Supabase DB.""")

st.markdown("""I'm pretty happy with where I'm at with this project (if I do say so myself), but here's a few things I want to add over time:

1. Enabling other Strava users to get their own charts - will do this once I wrap my head around oauth fully!
2. Webhook service - rather than polling the API every 15 minutes, I think a webhook would work better. Probably overkill, but good to learn.

Again, feedback always welcome :sunglasses:""")

* [My project repo](https://github.com/lzdnimer/stravalit): fork this repo!
* [Jessica Salbert - Holding your hand through Strava's API](https://jessicasalbert.medium.com/holding-your-hand-through-stravas-api-e642d15695f2): the best guide I found on using Strava's API and handling access/refresh tokens.
* [Tyler Richards' Goodreads Streamlit App](https://goodreads.streamlit.app/?ref=streamlit-io-gallery-data-visualization): I pretty much stole their Streamlit design - their github repo is a great resource. 
* [Polars](https://docs.pola.rs/) and [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/): very user-friendly docs.
